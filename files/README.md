# PDF File Location

Place your PDF file here with the filename: `x9k3f2_20-laws.pdf`

The server serves this file securely after payment verification.

**Important**: 
- The PDF is only accessible through secure, one-time download links
- Users must complete payment verification to receive a download token
- Download links expire after 24 hours and can only be used once

If you want to use a different filename, update the path in `server.js`:
```javascript
const pdfPath = path.join(__dirname, 'files', 'your-filename.pdf');
```
